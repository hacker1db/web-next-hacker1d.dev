## **DevOps Manifesto**

DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.

### What is DevOps

[https://github.blog/2020-10-07-devops-definition/](https://github.blog/2020-10-07-devops-definition/)

### Areaâ€™s to learn

- Commend line - most of the work I do is based on the fact that I am comfortable and fully understand the command line tools and parameters I can pass into these tools, said simply if you know how to use it locally you can use it in pipeline.
- Yaml syntax - [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema)
- GitHub flow - [https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- CI VS CD - [https://lab.github.com/MSUSDEV/build-end-to-end-cicd-capabilities-directly-in-github](https://lab.github.com/MSUSDEV/build-end-to-end-cicd-capabilities-directly-in-github)
- Conventional Commits - [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- IAC - [https://alpacked.io/blog/infrastructure-as-code-for-devops](https://alpacked.io/blog/infrastructure-as-code-for-devops)
- Branching Strategies - [https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/best-practices/git-branch-strategy](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/best-practices/git-branch-strategy)

### Git Workflow

[https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

### Branching Patterns

`Example: feature/1-MyReallyAwesomeFeatureThatWillMakeUsLotsOfMoney`

Branch prefix types

- feature
- bug
- chore

{{< highlight go >}}

{story type}/{pivotal tracker id}-{summary that is descriptive of the Story i.e the title}

{{< /highlight >}}

Branching patterns dictate how your workflow will end up being like, as is really the backbone for how you will build out your pipelines.
