- Package management, Installing, Updating, and locking the packages you use so you know what versoin of things you are using.
- [ Read I Want to learn DevOps]({{< ref "posts/DevOps/I-want-to-learn-DevOps" >}} "DevOps GettingStarted")
- Learn Git, start with GitHub they have [learning lab located here](https://lab.github.com/) this is free with an github account and its a great place to store your projects as you continue learning.

## How/where to learn

- Youtube! :) lots of free content
- Pick a language and follow along with that language's/framework _getting started guide_
- [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/) this is personally what I used to get a programing job its what helped me take on some the More Advanced but valuable topics.
- Blog posts, follow along with so you can see structure and look for the why behind it all.

## What lanague should I learn?

**The language does not matter!**
Use what language you are familiar with, that you are interested in learning. This will keep you engaged rather then
you end up getting frustratd that I did not tell you to learn _'X'_ language but just so you have some point of refernce. I
will be writing a more indepth blog post on what each languages are using for in gernal why.

- _Python Most start out with this language simply well becuase it simple to read and understand and its been around for a while._
- Javascript, is great for mostly frontend i.e web pages, and mobile dev where you want to keep it all in the same language.
  - React Native for Mobile Dev.
  - React for Frontend, Svelte, NextJs
  - NodeJs
    _Learn TypeScript_ if your going to write Javascript but learn the core concepts first.
- C#, Well known language in Enterprises and supportd by Microsoft.
- Go, and up and coming language put out by google

## _TLDR_

1. Build something you would use.
2. Build somehting you want to share (_Blogs are an easy first one._)
3. Rinse and repeat
4. The Language does matter at the end of the day it is personal prefernce.
